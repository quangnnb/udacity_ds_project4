# Lung cancer prediction

## Installations
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
sklearn
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in predicting customer churn for a fictional music streaming company: Sparkify.

## The project involved:
Loading and cleaning a small subset (8kB) of a 1000 unique patients
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting lung cancer
Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and GaussianNB.

## Wordress Blog Post
The exploration and analysis of this data have been published on wordress as a blog post, and you can access it by clicking [here](https://quangnnb.wordpress.com/2023/10/11/lung-cancer-prediction/).
DecisionTreeClassifier  was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics.
